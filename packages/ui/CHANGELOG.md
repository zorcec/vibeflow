### Patch Changes

- df7ecd6: Fix agent picker dropdown closing the detail panel. The outside-click handler on DetailPanel now correctly ignores clicks on the portaled agent picker dropdown, matching the existing behavior for model picker dropdowns and modal backdrops.
- defc6cf: Fix multi-select drag & drop to preserve relative order of selected tasks. Previously, all selected tasks were appended to the column bottom. Now they are inserted at the drop position with correct sort keys computed from the final arrangement. Added e2e Playwright test verifying the behavior.
